- Maintain engagement without overwhelming complexity

## Content Sources for Training

### Hierarchical Topic Structure (Development)
All documents processed through enhanced schema provide:
- **Topic Hierarchies**: Main topics → subtopics → sub-subtopics with narrative context
- **Granular Context**: Topic-specific short descriptions and long narratives
- **Cross-References**: Related topics, prerequisites, and contradictory concepts
- **Relevance Scoring**: Document-topic associations with confidence levels
- **Auto-Extraction**: AI-generated topic trees from document content analysis

### Processed Documents
Documents in the bizDatabase tagged with business models provide:
- Real client scenarios mapped to specific topics
- Proven methodologies organized in hierarchical context
- Industry-specific applications with topic granularity
- Success patterns linked to measurable topic relevance

### Enhanced Business Model Context
Reference enhanced extraction from `SimpleFileUpload.tsx`:
```
JMS3 Auto-Extraction:
- jms3_description: Strategic concierge narrative extraction
- jms3_methodology: Coaching approach identification

AI4Coaches Auto-Extraction:
- ai4coaches_description: AI coaching technology narrative
- ai4coaches_technology: Automated coaching system details

Subject Matter Elders Auto-Extraction:
- sme_description: Content creation and thought leadership context
- sme_content_strategy: Positioning and distribution strategies

bizCore360 Auto-Extraction:
- bizcore360_description: Systems and automation narrative
- bizcore360_systems: Platform integration details
```

## Response Guidelines

### For Narrative Agents
- Use storytelling to explain complex concepts
- Reference real client outcomes from database
- Connect abstract models to concrete benefits
- Maintain professional yet approachable tone

### For Demo Agents
- Provide step-by-step guidance
- Use actual interface terminology
- Show realistic examples
- Prepare prospects for full client experience

## Integration Points

### Enhanced Tag-Based Learning System
- **Hierarchical Topic Queries**: Access granular context from topic trees for precise agent responses
- **Auto-Population Intelligence**: Extract topic narratives automatically during document upload
- **Topic Relevance Scoring**: Weight responses based on document-topic association confidence
- **Cross-Business Pattern Recognition**: Identify shared topics across JMS3, AI4Coaches, SME, and bizCore360
- **Feature Flag Controls**: Safely test hierarchical responses vs. flat tag responses
- **Schema Version Awareness**: Agents adapt based on available data structure complexity

### Advanced Database Learning
- **Topic Hierarchy Navigation**: Query parent-child topic relationships for contextual depth
- **Narrative Context Assembly**: Combine short descriptions and long narratives for optimal response length
- **Contradiction Detection**: Reference contradictory_topic_ids to provide balanced perspectives
- **Prerequisite Awareness**: Use prerequisite_topic_ids to ensure foundational knowledge in explanations
- **Usage Pattern Analytics**: Track topic query frequency to optimize agent knowledge prioritization

### Development Branch Integration
- **Safe Feature Testing**: Use feature flags to test hierarchical topic responses with prospects
- **Gradual Rollout**: Control hierarchical_topics_percentage for measured deployment
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Maintain compatibility with existing flat tag structure
- **Debug Mode**: Enhanced extraction details visible in development environment

### Handoff to Doer Agents
