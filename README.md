- `jms3_description`: Strategic concierge narrative identification
- `jms3_methodology`: Coaching approach and leadership development context

**AI4Coaches Auto-Extraction**:
- `ai4coaches_description`: AI coaching technology narrative
- `ai4coaches_technology`: Automated coaching system details

**Subject Matter Elders Auto-Extraction**:
- `sme_description`: Content creation and thought leadership context  
- `sme_content_strategy`: Positioning and distribution strategies

**bizCore360 Auto-Extraction**:
- `bizcore360_description`: Systems and automation narrative
- `bizcore360_systems`: Platform integration and automation details

### üå≥ **Hierarchical Topics Structure (Development)**
```
Business Model (Level 1)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Strategic Leadership (Level 2)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Vision Setting (Level 3)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Decision Frameworks (Level 3)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Operational Excellence (Level 2)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Process Design (Level 3)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Team Development (Level 2)
```

Each topic contains:
- **Topic Name**: Clear identifier
- **Short Description**: Tagline for quick context
- **Long Narrative**: Full paragraph for detailed AI context
- **Hierarchical Relationships**: Parent-child topic chains
- **Cross-References**: Related, contradictory, and prerequisite topics

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Production Deployment (Stable)
```bash
git checkout master
npm install
npm run build
npx vercel --prod
```

### Development Environment (Hierarchical Topics)
```bash
git checkout feature/hierarchical-topics
.\setup_development.ps1  # Windows PowerShell
# OR
./setup_development.sh   # Linux/Mac

# Apply enhanced schema
# Copy hierarchical_topics_schema.sql to Supabase SQL Editor and run
```

### Environment Configuration
**Production** (`.env.production`):
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_HIERARCHICAL_TOPICS=false
NEXT_PUBLIC_DATABASE_SCHEMA_VERSION=1
# Conservative settings for production stability
```

**Development** (`.env.development`):
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_HIERARCHICAL_TOPICS=true
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_AUTO_TOPIC_EXTRACTION=true
NEXT_PUBLIC_DATABASE_SCHEMA_VERSION=2
# Enhanced features for testing
```

### Database Schema Setup
**Phase 1** (Production): Apply `supabase-schema.sql`
**Phase 2** (Development): Apply `hierarchical_topics_schema.sql` (additive)

### Feature Flag Controls
- **Safe Development**: New features controlled by environment variables
- **Gradual Rollout**: Percentage-based feature activation
- **Instant Rollback**: Feature flags allow immediate disable
- **Production Safety**: Conservative defaults with explicit opt-in

## üéØ What You'll See Working

### üìÑ **Enhanced Document Processing**
- **Auto-Upload Processing**: Documents populate database immediately during upload
- **Business Model Detection**: Automatic tagging and narrative extraction
- **Hierarchical Topic Extraction** (Development): Auto-generation of topic trees
- **Cross-Reference Intelligence**: Related topics and document associations
- **Multi-Format Support**: `.md`, `.pdf`, `.doc`, `.docx`, `.txt` files

### üß† **AI-Ready Hierarchical Data Structure**
- **Topic Trees**: Main topics ‚Üí subtopics ‚Üí sub-subtopics with full narrative context
- **Granular Context Access**: Surgical precision for AI agent responses
- **Auto-Populated Narratives**: Business model descriptions extracted during upload
- **Cross-Business Intelligence**: Shared topics across all Planet bizCORE models
- **Relevance Scoring**: Document-topic associations with confidence levels

### üö© **Feature Flag Controlled Development**

## Quick Test Checklist

### ‚úÖ Phase 1 Validation
- [ ] Upload a Markdown file successfully
- [ ] See parsed sections in the UI
- [ ] Verify psychological tags are extracted
- [ ] Check business domain classification
- [ ] Confirm data is saved to Supabase

### üéØ Ready for Your 150 Documents
Once the quick test passes, you can:
1. **Batch upload** multiple documents at once
2. **Browse and search** your knowledge base
3. **Export structured data** for AI training
4. **Track processing metrics** and insights

---

## Troubleshooting

### If Upload Fails:
- Check Supabase connection in browser console
- Verify environment variables are set correctly
- Ensure database schema was created successfully

### If Parsing Seems Off:
- Check the confidence scores in the UI
- Review the extracted tags and sections
- The system learns and improves with more documents
