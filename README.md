- **Auto-Population Metadata**: Extraction confidence, source documents, validation status
- **AI Training Optimization**: Context complexity scoring, usage frequency, accuracy tracking

### � **Development Setup & Testing Workflow**
**Production Workflow** (Master Branch):
```bash
git checkout master
npm install
npm run build
npx vercel --prod
```

**Development Workflow** (Feature Branch):
```bash
git checkout feature/hierarchical-topics
.\setup_development.ps1  # Windows PowerShell (automated setup)
# OR
./setup_development.sh   # Linux/Mac

# Apply enhanced schema to development database
# Run hierarchical_topics_schema.sql in Supabase SQL Editor
```

### 🔧 **Environment Configuration System**
**Production Configuration** (`.env.production`):
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_HIERARCHICAL_TOPICS=false
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_AUTO_TOPIC_EXTRACTION=false
NEXT_PUBLIC_DATABASE_SCHEMA_VERSION=1
NEXT_PUBLIC_HIERARCHICAL_TOPICS_PERCENTAGE=0
# Conservative settings prioritizing stability
```

**Development Configuration** (`.env.development`):
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_HIERARCHICAL_TOPICS=true
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_AUTO_TOPIC_EXTRACTION=true
NEXT_PUBLIC_DATABASE_SCHEMA_VERSION=2
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_DEBUG_MODE=true
NEXT_PUBLIC_HIERARCHICAL_TOPICS_PERCENTAGE=100
# Full feature access for testing and validation
```

### 🗄️ **Database Schema Evolution**
**Schema Version 1** (Production): `supabase-schema.sql` - Wide columns for auto-population
**Schema Version 2** (Development): `hierarchical_topics_schema.sql` - Additive hierarchical tables

### 🚩 **Feature Flag Safety System**
- **Development Safety**: New features isolated to feature branch
- **Production Protection**: Conservative defaults with explicit feature opt-in
- **Gradual Rollout Support**: Percentage-based user activation for measured deployment
- **Instant Rollback**: Environment variable changes disable features immediately
- **Debug Controls**: Enhanced logging and extraction details in development mode

## 🎯 What You'll See Working

## Quick Test Checklist

### ✅ Phase 1 Validation
- [ ] Upload a Markdown file successfully
- [ ] See parsed sections in the UI
- [ ] Verify psychological tags are extracted
- [ ] Check business domain classification
- [ ] Confirm data is saved to Supabase

### 🎯 Ready for Your 150 Documents
Once the quick test passes, you can:
1. **Batch upload** multiple documents at once
2. **Browse and search** your knowledge base
3. **Export structured data** for AI training
4. **Track processing metrics** and insights

---

## Troubleshooting

### If Upload Fails:
- Check Supabase connection in browser console
- Verify environment variables are set correctly
- Ensure database schema was created successfully

### If Parsing Seems Off:
- Check the confidence scores in the UI
- Review the extracted tags and sections
- The system learns and improves with more documents
