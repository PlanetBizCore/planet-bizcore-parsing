# PBC Parsing App Development Session - Meta-Learning Example

**Date**: January 17, 2025  
**Participants**: John Mueller (Planet BizCORE), GitHub Copilot (AI Assistant)  
**Session Type**: System Architecture & Implementation  
**Duration**: Extended development session  

## Executive Summary

This conversation represents a foundational example of **human-AI collaborative system design** with meta-learning capabilities. We designed and implemented Phase 1 of the PBC Parsing App while simultaneously building the framework for Phase 2 AI agent training, including the capability to parse this very conversation as training data.

## Key Strategic Decisions

### 1. Database Architecture: Wide vs Deep Strategy
**Decision**: Implement wide table strategy for AI agent optimization
