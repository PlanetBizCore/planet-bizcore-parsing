-- Database Cleanup Script for Fresh Start with Hierarchical Topics
-- Run this in Supabase SQL Editor to clear existing data and prepare for enhanced testing

-- WARNING: This will delete all processed documents and related data
-- Ensure you have backups if needed

-- Clear document processing data (cascade will handle related records)
-- Note: document_processing_status is a view, so we don't delete from it directly
DELETE FROM sections WHERE 1=1;
DELETE FROM documents WHERE 1=1;

-- Clear any existing hierarchical topics data (only if tables exist)
-- Use DO blocks to conditionally delete only if tables exist
